# ds_2 Project 2


## Goal:
To gain a better understanding of search algorithms and symbol tables by
implementing an autocompletion engine.


## Background:
In order to make typing on a mobile device quick and easy, an autocomplete
feature is commonly implemented to try to guess what word a user wishes to type
before they are finished. Such a feature requires extensive use of search
algorithms. Here, you will be building the backend of an autocomplete engine
(i.e., you won't gathering any user input).
