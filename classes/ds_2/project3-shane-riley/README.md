# ds_2 Project 3

## Goal:
To explore an advanced application of priority queues in order to gain a deeper
understanding of the data structure.


## High-level description:
You will be writing a basic application to help a user select a car to buy.
You should write a PQ-based data structure that stores objects according to the
relative priorities of two of their attributes, making it efficient to retrieve
objects with the minimum value of either attribute. Your data structure should
further be indexable to allow for efficient updates of entered items. You will
want users to be able to enter details about cars that they are considering
buying. The user should then be able to efficiently retrieve the car with the
lowest mileage or lowest price.  These retrievals should be possible on the set
of all entered cars or on the set of all cars of a specific make and model
(e.g., "lowest price Ford Fiesta", "lowest mileage Cadillac Escalade").
