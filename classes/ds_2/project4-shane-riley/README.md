# ds_2 Project 4

## Goal:
To gain a better understanding of graphs and graph algorithms through practical
implementation.


## High-level description:
Your program will analyze a given graph representing a computer network
according to several specified metrics. The vertices of these graphs will
represent switches in the network, while the edges represent either fiber optic
or copper cables run between the switches.
