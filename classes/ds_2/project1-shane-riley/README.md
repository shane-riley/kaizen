# ds_2 Project 1

## Goal:
To gain a better understanding of tree data structures by implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Background:
We have discussed BSTs in depth in lecture. Here, you will be implementing a basic BST that supports several methods.
Your BST need only store keys, it does **not** need to store key/value pairs.
