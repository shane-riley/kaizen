For which of the three representations is the within-between ratio smallest?
Out of the three representations (BOW, texture concat and texture mean),
BOW is able to reach the lowest ratio, but only with the right hyperparameters (number of clusters, number of keypoints).

Does the answer to this question depend on the value of k that you use?
Changing k does change the BOW ratios, with k=2 consistently outperforming the other options

Does it depend on the number of keypoints you extract? (Try 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.)
Like k, changing the number of keypoints does change the outcome ratio. In this test, 1000 keypoints before non-max suppression
with k = 2 reveals the best ratio overall.

Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one? How can you tell?
Bag-of-words appears to have the greatest potential, since it is capable of producing
the highest ratios. With that said, BOW has hyperparameters (num keys and k)
that if badly tuned, can make the ratio result much worse than texture mean, which is consistently effective.

Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
I expected Bag-of-Words to outperform the texture-based methods, but I did not expect the margin to be so small, and the result to be so sensitive to hyperparameters.

STDOUT:
Note: The number of keypoints is before non-max suppression is executed
