STDOUT from compare_representations.m:

Train Accuracies:
Level 0		Level 1		Pyramid
0.3975		0.6538		0.6737

Test Accuracies:
Level 0		Level 1		Pyramid
0.3925		0.5450		0.5625

The accuracies shown from the SVM models are consistent with expectations.
The level 0 representations contain bag-of-words representations for the whole
image, without any regard for location within the image. Level 1 contains this
information, while the pyramid contains everything. That is why the pyramid
representation outperforms both others--it is capturing additional useful information.
Additionally, it can be seen that the training accuracies are better than the
test accuracies, which is typical of any trained model (in this case, SVM).
