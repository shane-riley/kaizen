The plot is consistent with expectation. First, the performance on the training
data outperforms that of the test data for KNN and SVM separately, which is
typical of trained models. It is also expected that the SVM accuracies will
not vary with 'k', since that is a hyperparameter for KNN. On the KNN-side,
it is clear that low values of k are overfitting, since performance on test
data is much lower than on the training data. If one were to tune the value
of k to provide the best performance on testing data, they would choose k = 13.
In general, however, the SVM model outperforms the KNN models handedly.
