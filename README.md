# kaizen

My repository of coursework, practice problems and 'continuous improvement'. This repo includes all code written that is not copyright for research, employment, or wrapped into personal or team projects.

The purpose of storing this code is to witness my own growth as a programmer, to use as motivation to keep striving to improve.

__NOTE: THIS REPO IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION__
